Now that we've seen object destructuring and property value shorthand, let's apply them!

## Learning Goals

- Reinforce using object destructuring to access object properties
- Reinforce using property value shorthand to assign object properties

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get object-destructuring-drills
cd object-destructuring-drills
code .
open index.html
```

Your work will go in the `objectDestructuring.js` and `propertyValueShorthand.js` files.

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in the `objectDestructuring.js` and `propertyValueShorthand.js` files to practice using object destructuring and property value shorthand. Opening the `index.html` file in this directory will allow you to view the output from both files in your browser console.
