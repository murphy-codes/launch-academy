## Instructions

In this exercise, you will build and work with a Grocery List using arrays.

### Getting Set Up

```no-highlight
$ et get grocery-list-array
$ cd grocery-list-array
$ code .
```

You're going to the grocery store and decide to use an array to keep track of your shopping list.

Write a program in `code.js` that:

1. Creates an array to represent your shopping list with the following items: 'pop tarts', 'ramen noodles', 'chips', 'salsa', and 'coffee'.
2. Adds 'fruit loops' to the list.
3. Updates 'coffee' to 'fair trade coffee'
4. Replaces 'chips' and 'salsa' with 'rice' and 'beans'
5. Creates an empty array to represent your shopping cart.
6. Removes the last item from your shopping list and add it to your cart
7. Removes the first item from your shopping list and add it to the cart
8. Writes a 'while' loop that takes items from your shopping list and moves them to your cart until there are no items left on the list.
9. Sorts the items in your cart alphabetically... backwards
10. Prints the list of items in your shopping cart to the console as a comma separated string.
