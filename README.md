A compilation of most of work I completed for Launch Academy during my time in the Apprenti 3 cohort.

The goal of these lessons was to give the students a solid foundation of knowledge to build upon. Lessons were grouped by week, and covered the following topics: Setting up your development environment, learning the Command Line Interface, the basics of programming in the JavaScript Programming Language, Object-Oriented Programming, the basics of the Java programming language, HTML, and CSS, as well as working with React and Spring.
