# Launch Academy

## Week 9

Week 9 at Launch Academy followed a different format than our prior weeks. We did not have various (exercise & challenge) assignments throughout the week, we did not have a system check (exam) at the end of the week, nor did we have (classes) morning mentor groups, facilitations, or clinic. Instead, this week was dedicated entirely to a group project where each group worked to build a functioning site (both front-end and back-end) that would allow for the adoption and surrender of pets from/to an animal shelter. The purpose of this week was to teach the use of git/github and working within a development teach.

## Node Group Project

We at Launch Academy are big fans of pets. There are many pets out there looking for a home. Our challenge for this week was to build an app that allows good pets to find their ultimate destination!
