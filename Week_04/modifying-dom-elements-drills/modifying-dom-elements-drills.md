Let's get some practice modifying the DOM!

## Learning Goals

- Modify the tag name, attributes, and text of an HTML element
- Create a new HTML element and insert it into the DOM
- Remove an HTML element from the DOM

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get modifying-dom-elements-drills
cd modifying-dom-elements-drills
open index.html
code .
```

Your work will go in the `main.js` file.

### Instructions

Without modifying `index.html`, achieve the following. Reload your page as you update `main.js` to see your updates in action. You can inspect the page by right-clicking and choosing "Inspect" to see the resulting HTML and all related classes, etc.

1. Print to the console the text of any elements with a class of `oh-no`
2. Print to the console the tag name of the element with an id of `hashtag-inspiration`
3. Print to the console the HTML contained within any elements with a class of `tv`
4. Reluctantly fix the typo "Never gonna run around and dessert you" to "Never gonna run around and desert you", where "desert" has one `s`
5. Replace the text in the fourth child of the element with an id of `purple-jaguar-eye` with lyrics of your choosing
6. Turn each `<h2>` into an `<h3>`
7. Add a class of `scary-thoughts` to the element with an id of `woof`
8. Add an image of a fish as the last child of the element with an id of `she's-the-one-for-me`
9. Delete the class `rickroll` from the div that also contains the class `limerickroll`
10. Add your own lyrics as the last child of the element with an id of `lyrics`
11. Add a new paragraph explaining what your favorite song is as the last child of `<body>`
12. Add an attribute called `foo`, with a value of `bar`, to each child of the element with a class of `rickroll`
