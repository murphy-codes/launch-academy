        <p>
          Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. The name “Sirius” is
          derived from the Ancient Greek “Seirios“, which translates to
          “glowing” or “scorcher”. Whereas it appears to be a single bright star
          to the naked eye, Sirius is actually a binary star system, consisting
          of a white main-sequence star named Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf
          companion named Sirius B.

              The origin of the phrase "The Dog Days of Summer" is due to the
              ancient Romans associating the hottest days of summer with the
              star Sirius.

              Sirius is the brightest star in the constellation "Canis Major"
              (Large Dog).

              Speaking of constellations, Sirius is known as Orion the Hunter's
              dog, since it follows Orion into the night sky.

        <p>
          Pronounced “Beetle-juice” (yes, the same as the 1988 Tim Burton
          movie), this star is a bright red supergiant. In 1985, Margarita
          Karovska and colleagues from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics, announced the discovery of two close companions orbiting
          Betelgeuse. While this remains unconfirmed, the existence of possible
          companions remains an intriguing possibility.

              The star’s name is derived from the Arabic name Ibt al-Jauza’,
              which literally means “the hand of Orion”. And indeed, it is in
              the position of Orion's hand in the constellation!

        <p>
          Also known as the “Seven Sisters”, Messier 45 or M45, Pleiades is
          actually an open star cluster located in the constellation of Taurus.
          Though the seven largest stars are the most apparent, the cluster
          actually consists of over 1,000 confirmed members (along with several
          unconfirmed binaries). The core radius of the cluster is about 8 light
          years across, while it measures some 43 light years at the outer
          edges. It is dominated by young, hot blue stars, though brown dwarfs –
          which are just a fraction of the Sun’s mass – are believed to account
          for 25% of its member stars.
