Let's reinforce those element-finding skills!

## Learning Goals

- Retrieve elements from the DOM based on a variety of criteria, using the best suited method

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get accessing-dom-elements-drills
cd accessing-dom-elements-drills
code .
```

Your work will go in the `main.js` file.

### Instructions

Use the methods for accessing the DOM to find:

1. An element with an id of `i-love-educated-lizards`
2. All elements with a class of `recipe-idea`
3. Using the result from #2, access the second element with this class
4. All `<div>` elements
5. All `<h2>` elements with a class of `lyrics`
6. The parent of the element whose `id` is `purple-jaguar-eye`
7. The children of the element whose `id` is `purple-jaguar-eye`
8. Using the result from #7, the sixth child of that element
9. The element with classes of both `recipe-idea` and `intentional-misspelling-of-desert` (using just one line of code)

Additionally,

10. Tell me how many elements are children of the element with an id of `limerickroll`
