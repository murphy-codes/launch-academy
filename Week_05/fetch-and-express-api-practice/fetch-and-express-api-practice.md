## Apply your understanding of Fetch!

Now that you have become familiar with some of the utility of fetch, build on the work you did in the previous exercise.

## Instructions

Begin by running:

```no-highlight
et get fetch-and-express-api-practice
cd fetch-and-express-api-practice
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

The data has already been fetched from its source. Your job is to:

1. Create a new list item for each book title.
2. Append each list item to the unordered list on the index page.

jQuery has been included for you if you have knowledge of jQuery and would prefer to use jQuery selectors and DOM manipulation.
