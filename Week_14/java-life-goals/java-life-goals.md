We're going to make a web page that lists all of your life goals (or at least a few :-))

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get java-life-goals
cd java-life-goals
idea .
```

## List Your Life Goals

Much of the setup has been done for you. Your task is to build an `ArrayList` of goals in your `index.jsp` JSP file. Then, use that `ArrayList` and what you know of iteration to output them on the webpage as an unordered list.

A good example will use expressions, declarations, and directives. You could also read ahead to serlvets and include those as well!

Remember, you'll have to use Maven's `tomcat7` tasks to run your application.
