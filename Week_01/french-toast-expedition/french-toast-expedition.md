### Introduction

Winter is coming - and you're spending the holidays at home in Boston.

At the slightest hint of snow in the Northeast United States, the demand for
milk, bread, and eggs skyrockets. Grocery store shelves are left barren of
these key ingredients.  

We can only assume that the [French Toast Alert level](http://www.universalhub.com/french-toast) is on the rise.

### Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get french-toast-expedition
cd french-toast-expedition
```
To run your code,

```no-highlight
open index.html
code .

> your work will go in `main.js`
```

In the browser, open up the JavaScript console. You can refresh the page in order to see your changes.

### Elevated Conditions

Let's get to the grocery store before there's nothing left!

Write some JavaScript code to calculate the cost of purchasing the following and output the total to the JavaScript Console. We'll want to declare our variables and store the numerical prices for each item. Declare a `totalCost` variable that stores the total cost of all your items then `console.log` the results.

* A loaf of bread: $1.99
* A gallon of milk: $3.89
* One dozen eggs: $2.29

Expected output:
```no-highlight
=> Your total cost is: $8.17
```

{% show_hint %}
console.log(`Your total cost is: $${totalCost}`)
{% endshow_hint %}

### Severe Conditions!

We have a [Nor'easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nor%27easter) sweeping
through that's going to leave us under three-stories of snow!

Our precious French Toast ingredients are now three times the original price, but nothing will stop us from making our beloved breakfast!

Write some JavaScript code to calculate the cost of purchasing French Toast
ingredients at 3x the market rate.
HINT: You should not have to change your `console.log` statement in order to see the information update!


Expected output:
```no-highlight
=> Your total cost is: $24.51
```

### Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et submit` command to submit your code from this project's folder.
