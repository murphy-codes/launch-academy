The `main.js` file contains several variables containing quotes from Terry Pratchett books. These strings are not correctly formatted for the computer to read. Your job is to edit the provided text and `console.log` each one in the format provided to you below. And if you've never read a Terry Pratchett book, what are you waiting for?!

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get js-formatting-drills
cd js-formatting-drills
open index.html
code .
```

### Work that Magic

Using the provided text in `main.js`, edit the strings in each variable so it prints to the console exactly as you see here:

1) Thief of Time
```no-highlight
"Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.
If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 
'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH',
the paint wouldn't even have time to dry"
```

2) Sourcery
```no-highlight
"I meant," said Ipslore bitterly, "what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?"

 Death thought about it.

"CATS," he said eventually. "CATS ARE NICE."
```

3) Mort
```no-highlight
“Albert grunted. "Do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions?"
Mort thought for a moment.
"No," he said eventually, "what?"

There was silence.

Then Albert straightened up and said, "Damned if I know. Probably they get answers, and serve 'em right.”
```

4) The Wee Free Men
```no-highlight
“The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you have no teeth. 

It was enough to be called a witch.

If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything.

It talked about "a handsome prince"...was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called handsome? 

As for "a girl who was as beautiful as the day was long"...well, which day? In midwinter it hardly ever got light! 

The stories don't want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told...”
```
