Exclusively using command line commands, implement the file structure outlined in the diagram below.

1. Build out the file paths in the image. Every highlighted word is a new directory (folder) and the non-highlighted words are plain old files. Use `mkdir` and `touch` to generate this structure.

2. Starting in the root directory, execute a command to navgiate to the directory called `food`.

3. From the `food` directory, execute a single command to navigate to Poe, EdgarAllen.

4. Execute a command from the root directory that describes the contents of `Poe, EdgarAllen`.

5. Navigate to `images`, and use the command that will tell you the absolute path of where you are in the filesystem.

6. While in `images`, create a folder called photographs.

7. Navigate to your new directory, and create a new file called `sunrise`. Make it a `.jpg` file.

8. Now move that file up one directory.

9. Change directories to the `like` folder under `monkeys`. Open this folder in VSCode.

10. Remove the `bananas.html` file from the `like` folder.
