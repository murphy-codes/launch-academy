In this exercise, we'll create an object hierarchy that leverages an Abstract class.

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get java-abstract-shapes

## Create Your Shapes Object Hierarchy

### Implement a Rectangle Class

Define a `Rectangle` class that takes a width and height in its constructor. Define and implement `perimeter` and `area` methods that accurately calculate those values for a given instance.

### Extract an Abstract Shape Class

Define an abstract `Shape` class from which `Rectangle` inherits. It should define abstract methods for `perimeter` and `area`.

### Implement a Circle Class

Now, implement a `Circle` class that inherits from the `abstract` class Shape. Use the guidance from the `Shape` class to implement the required methods for the `Circle`.
