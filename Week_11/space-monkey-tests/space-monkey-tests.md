## Entrance Exam!

As a prospective Space Monkey cadet at Space Monkey Academy, training to join the ranks in the battle to protect all primate kind against The Great Feline Alliance, there a few basic tests of intelligence you need to pass as a first step in gaining entry. You can already sense that the questions will be extremely difficult...

## Intructions

Run the tests located in the MonkeyTest class and based off what the compiler tells you, write code to solve and pass the tests one at a time.

# Non-Core
Note: You may have to lookup the JUnit documentation or read ahead to answer do this portion.

## The Kobayashi Maru... kinda...

The Kobayashi Maru is a unwinnable test made to test leadership... but the proctor forgot how to setup the test!
As an intelligent prospective cadet you take on the task of setting up the test yourself!

- Write a new test that checks to see if the instantiated monkey's quote _contains_ any "errors".
- Write a method that returns the instaniated monkey's full name, favorite food and favorite quote.
- Write a new test that checks to see if the above method's return _contains_ the word "Banana".
