In an all-too-real dystopian future, Amazon and Apple have merged. They've successfully lobbied against anti-trust regulation, and they have cornered the consumer electronics market. Demand for their latest Premium Robot Assistants (The iFireBot) have soared to the point where purchasing one costs a small mortgage. Nonetheless, there's still a line a mile long on release day, and Double A (Amazon/Apple) has employed you to manage a script to keep track of the queue at one of their main stores. Follow along with the narrative (and some Java) to keep an accurate account of who's in line.

Developers who can't manage the queue...will be terminated. Just kidding?!?

- Double A fans have arrived four months early. By recent Federal statute, Double A sent them home with a voucher to reclaim their place when they show up 60 days before robot release day. Load `initial-line.txt` to reflect who's in line first, in order. The first person in the text file should be first in line.
- Jim, Joan, Lisa, and Marc arrive on Day 59.
- Jim allows his friend, Fran, to cut him in line. Add Fran to the queue.
- After a brief conversation with Double A staff, Jim and Fran subsequently disappear. No one hears from them again. Remove them from the line.
- It's finally release day, but Double A is short on inventory. Only the first 5 people in line can purchase. Poll them off the line as happy customers. Ouput their names to announce how lucky they are.
- The last three people in line lose hope of ever getting their hands on a robot. Remove them from the line.
- Double A wants to know how many people are left in line. Output the length of the queue.
- Alex is heard speaking negatively of Double A's production capability. A Double A Associate resembling a young Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen removing her from the premises. She should be removed from the queue.
- There are grumblings of a revolt. Double A quickly ships one iFireBot to please the masses. Who's the lucky recipient? (Output the first person in the queue)
